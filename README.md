## [MOD] Lenovo Watch's notification apps substitution

[Download](https://github.com/ERap320/LenovoWatchMOD/archive/master.zip)

Lenovo Watch is the application used to pair and set the Lenovo Watch 9.
One of the main "smart" functions of the watch is to vibrate when you get a notifications in one of the selected apps. The problem is that 4 of the 8 possible apps are services only used in China, and Skype doesn't work.

The objective of this mod is to give the watch a bit more functionality for non-chinese users.

I fixed Skype and made these substitutions:
* WeChat -> Telegram
* QQ -> Microsoft Outlook
* Weibo -> Google Calendar
* Line -> Clock
