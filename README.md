Lenovo Watch is the application used to pair and set the Lenovo Watch 9, Lenovo Watch X and Lenovo Watch X Plus.  
One of the main "smart" functions of the watch is to vibrate when you get a notifications in one of the selected apps.
- The problem is that 4 of the 8 possible apps are services only used in China, and Skype doesn't work.
- The Watch X and Watch X Plus are not supported char with  accented and only show the messages until the first accented chars
- The Watch X and Watch X Plus Gmail notification's subject value is [null]

The objective of this mod is to give the watch a bit more functionality for non-chinese users.

- I fixed Skype, Facebook Messenger and made these substitutions:
* WeChat -> Telegram
* QQ -> Microsoft Outlook
* Weibo -> Google Calendar
* Line -> Gmail
* Tencent Tim -> Telegram X

- Fixed the accented chars to replace with the non accented pair in the message.  So the result will be áéíóöőúüű -> aeiooouuu.
- Fixed Gmail notification and display the subject correctly

## Content of the repository
The commits of this repository contain new versions of the modified .apk

If you need an older version of the app take a look at older [Releases](https://github.com/ERap320/LenovoWatchMOD/releases). The tag of the commits will be the version of the Lenovo Watch app used as a base for the mod.

**Attention!** Starting with version 3.0.8 the original LenovoWatch app includes measures to prevent mods like this one. As a result, the latest version of the MOD (based on the original Version 3.0.3) also prevents updates. This means no newer versions of this MOD will be released until a method of circumventing abovementioned measures is found.

Meanwhile, you can use Version 3.0.3_noupdate indefinitely.
