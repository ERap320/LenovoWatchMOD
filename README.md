Lenovo Watch is the application used to pair and set the Lenovo Watch 9. Lenovo Watch X and Lenovo Watch X Plus
There are serval issues with the notifications. One is the watch and the app can't hadle accented chars. In that case the watch lost the text after the first accented chars and show nothing.


The objective of this mod is to fix this issue replacaing the accented chars to a non accented pair, as the watch can't handle the accented one..
